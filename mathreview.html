        Here are some important concepts you'll need to know to solve our "musical" math exercises!<br><br>
        <b>Order of Operations:</b>
        <dl>
          <dt><span style="color: rgb(187, 120, 250);">&#9834</span> For the "bonus operation" problems, you will need to remember your order of operations.</dt>
          <dt><span style="color: rgb(187, 120, 250);">&#9834</span> The following device can help you memorize: "Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally," or PEMDAS!</dt>
          <dd>-This stands for the order: 
            <ol>
              <li>Parentheses</li>
              <li>Exponents</li>
              <li>Multiplication</li>
              <li>Division</li>
              <li>Addition</li>
              <li>Subtraction</li>
            </ol></dd>
            <dt><span style="color: rgb(187, 120, 250);">&#9834</span> In our math problems, we won't see parentheses or exponents.</dt>
            <dd>-Let's explore some examples. 
              <ul>
                <li>6 - 2 + 3 = 7. In this example, we have only subtraction and addition. The order between subtraction and addition does NOT matter. So we solve from left to right.</li>
                <li>8 &divide 4 &times 5 = 10. In this example, we have only division and addition. The order between division and multiplication does NOT matter. So we solve from left to right.</li>
                <li>12 &divide 3 + 7 = 11. In this example, we have division and addition. Here, the order matters, but we can still solve from left to right.</li>
                <li>15 - 6 &times 2 = 3. In this example we have subtraction and multiplication. Here, the order matters, so we do NOT solve left to right. First, multiply 6 by 2 (which equals 12). Then subtract that from 15. 15 - 12 = 3.</li>
              </ul></dd>
             
        </dl>
        <b>Fractions:</b> 
        <dl>
          <dt><span style="color: rgb(187, 120, 250);">&#9834</span> Mixed number conversion: since our input currently supports improper fractions only, you will have to convert between these two forms.</dt>
          <dd>-Let's use 3 and 1/2 as an example. 
            <ol>
              <li>You take the whole number (3) and multiply that by the denominator of the fraction (2).</li>
              <li>Then add the numerator of the fraction (1) to that product (3 &times 2 = 6 and 6 + 1 = 7).</li>
              <li>Put that number over the fraction denominator (7/2) and you're done!</li>
            </ol></dd>
            <dd>-3 and 1/2 = 7/2</dd>
            <br>
          <dt><span style="color: rgb(187, 120, 250);">&#9834</span> Dividing by Fractions</dt>
          <dd>-Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by that fraction's reciprocal.</dd>
          <dd>-A <b>reciprocal</b> is the opposite of a fraction. You flip the numerator and the denominator. For example: the reciprocal of 5/9 is 9/5.</dd>
          <dd>-Let's use 1/2 &divide 1/4 as an example.
            <ol>
              <li>Find the reciprocal of the divisor (the second number) only. In this problem the divisor is 1/4</li>
              <li>Now our problem is 1/2 &times 4/1</li>
              <li>Solve: 1 &times 4 = 4 and 2 &times 1 = 2. 4/2 = 2</li>
            </ol>
          </dd>
          <dd>-1/2 &divide 1/4 = 2</dd>
        </dl>
        <br>

        And that's it! Practice lots and have fun!
